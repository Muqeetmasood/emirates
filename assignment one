1. Divisibility Check of two numbers
Write a Python program to check whether a number is completely divisible by another number. Accept two integer values form the user

Code:

for i in range(2):
    num=int(input("Enter numerator :"))
    den=int(input("Enter denominator:"))
    if num%den==0:
        print("Number",num,"is completely divisible by",den)
    else:
        print("Number",num,"is not completely divisible by",den)
OUTPUT:

Enter numerator :8
Enter denominator:4
Number 8 is completely divisible by 4
Enter numerator :20
Enter denominator:6
Number 20 is not completely divisible by 6

Process finished with exit code 0

2. Copy string n times
Write a Python program to get a string which is n (non-negative integer) copies of a given string.

print("Program to make copies of given string!\n")
string=str(input("Enter a string :"))
copy=int(input("How many copies of string you need :"))
copies=(string * copy)
print(copy,"copies of",string,"are",copies)

OUTPUT:
Enter a string :muqeet
How many copies of string you need :2
2 copies of muqeet are muqeetmuqeet

3. Vowel Tester
Write a Python program to test whether a passed letter is a vowel or not

Code:

print("Program to check the given character is vowel or not!\n")
for i in range(3):
    a=str(input("Enter the character :"))
    b=a.casefold()
    if b in "aeiou":5
        print("Given character is a vowel!")
    else:
        print("Give character is not a vowel!")

Output
Give character is not a vowel!
Enter the character :diii
Give character is not a vowel!
Enter the character :i
Given character is a vowel!


4. Odd No.s
Use the third argument of the range() function to make a list of the odd numbers from 1 to 20. Use a for loop to print each number.

Code:
print("Program to check odd no between 1 to 20!\n")
odd=[]
for i in range(1,20,2):
    odd.append(i)
print(odd)

OUTPUT

Program to check odd no between 1 to 20!

[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]

5. Food Slicing
Make a python program that contains your nine favourite dishes in a list called foods.Print the message,

The first three items in the list are:

Then use a slice to print the first three items from that programâ€™s list.Print the message,

Three items from the middle of the list are:

Use a slice to print three items from the middle of the list.Print the message,

The last three items in the list are:

Use a slice to print the last three items in the list.
CODE:

print("Program to print first 3 middle 3 and last three elements using slicing !\n")
food=['biryani','lasagnia','tikka','broast','burger','zinger','kofta','mutton','beef']
print("The first three items in a list of food are :",food[0:3])
print("The middle three items in a list of food are :",food[3:6])
print("The last three items in a list of food are :",food[6:9])

OUTPUT:
Program to print first 3 middle 3 and last three elements using slicing !

The first three items in a list of food are : ['biryani', 'lasagnia', 'tikka']
The middle three items in a list of food are : ['broast', 'burger', 'zinger']
The last three items in a list of food are : ['kofta', 'mutton', 'beef']
